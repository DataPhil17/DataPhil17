# Predictive Analytics: Healthcare Outcomes

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, SHAP, Excel  
**Dataset:** MIMIC-IV (ICU Patient Outcomes)  

---

## 📌 Overview
This project applies predictive analytics to forecast patient readmission risk in hospitals.  
It uses healthcare data to identify risk factors and support decision-making for improved patient outcomes.

---

## 🔑 Key Steps
- Cleaned and processed patient records from MIMIC-IV dataset  
- Built regression and classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- Evaluated models using AUC-ROC and Precision-Recall  
- Applied SHAP values for model interpretability  

---

## 📊 Results
- Random Forest achieved an AUC of **0.89**  
- Key predictors: length of stay, comorbidities, and prior admissions

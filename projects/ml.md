# Machine Learning: Spotify Genre Prediction

**Tools:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, pandas  
**Dataset:** Spotify API / Kaggle Spotify Dataset  

---

## Overview
This project builds machine learning models to predict the genre of a song based on its audio features.  
The goal is to explore how measurable characteristics of music relate to genre classification.

---

## 🔑 Key Steps 🔑
- Collected and cleaned audio feature data using the Spotify API  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on tempo, danceability, and acousticness  
- Trained Random Forest and Neural Network models  
- Compared performance using accuracy and F1-score  

---

## 📊 Results 📊
- Best model: Random Forest with ****  
- Key feature importance:

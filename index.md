# üëãüèæ Hi, I'm Philippe Louis Jr.

**Aspiring Data Scientist | AI/ML Enthusiast**

I am currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies (iSchool). With over 3 years of experience in data analysis, 1+ year in compliance reporting, and 2+ years in program development, I bring both technical expertise and strategic insight to my work. Much of my professional career has been as a Science and Math teacher, where I approached teaching with the mindset of a data-driven problem solver, tailoring lessons to measurably improve student performance. As I transition into data science, I have secured a role as a Data Coordinator, advancing my career pipeline by leveraging **machine learning and data storytelling** to solve real-world challenges and deliver impactful insights.
